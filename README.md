## Ben Trettin

Personal Bash Shell in C

## Compile code

Download the Zip file. Unzip the code

To compile the code, cd into the shell directory and run

```

## Running Shell

To run the program, run the following command inside the same directory

```
./bash
```

This will create my shell and you can include input thereafter.
